# bookmark-toolbox

⚠️ DEPRECATED: This repository is deprecated, as I don't use bookmark-toolbox any more or have the time to maintain it. For now, it will remain here in case anyone wishes to fork and maintain it.

Generic command-line toolbox tool for bookmarks. Currently this is very limited, but it is planned to add more capabilities.

## Installation

* `gem install bundler`
* `bundler install`

## Running

For instructions, run `bookmark-toolbox help`.
